          <p> <br> <strong>What is the Universe? </strong> 
          </br>
    The universe is everything we know, everything we see, and everything we are. It encompasses galaxies, stars, planets, and the infinite spaces in between. Picture it as a grand tapestry woven with the threads of time and space, stretching beyond our wildest imagination.</p>

            <div>
                <h1> <bold>Solar System; An overview</h1>
            <p>Our solar system has one star, eight planets, five officially recognized dwarf planets, at least 290 moons, more than 1.3 million asteroids, and about 3,900 comets.
    
    It is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.
    
    We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris – along with hundreds of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.
    
    Our solar system is the only one we know of that has a planet that supports life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we’re looking for life on other worlds.

          <h1> Stars</h1>
          
          <h4> Stars, those twinkling wonders, come in diverse types. Some burn bright and hot, while others are cool and steady. Their life cycles are cosmic tales, from birth to dazzling finales.
    
          </h4>
                  <p> <strong> Protostars: </strong>These cosmic nurseries birth stars from dense clouds of gas and dust. Gravity pulls material together, and as the protostar forms, it heralds the beginning of a stellar journey.
    
          </p></br>
                    
                     <p> <strong> Main Sequence Stars: </strong> The phase where stars spend most of their lives, including our sun. Here, hydrogen fuses into helium, releasing energy in a delicate cosmic dance.
          </p></br>
    <p> <strong> Red Giants and Super Giants: </strong> Stars, like aging performers, swell in size as they deplete their nuclear fuel. The once-diminished star becomes a grand, glowing giant, illuminating the cosmos.
          </p></br> 
    <p> <strong> Supernovae: </strong> The grand finale for massive stars. In a spectacular explosion, they release energy equivalent to the brightness of entire galaxies. Supernovae scatter heavy elements, enriching the cosmos.
          </p></br>
    <p> <strong>Neutron Stars and Black Holes: </strong>The remnants of stellar fireworks. Neutron stars pack the mass of the sun into a city-sized space, while black holes, with their gravitational might, defy comprehension.

          <h4> Galaxies, the sprawling metropolises of the cosmos, showcase a mesmerizing diversity in shapes and sizes.
          </h4>
          <p><strong>Spiral Galaxies: </strong> Elegant spirals with majestic arms, like the Milky Way. Stars orbit a central hub, creating a cosmic dance that paints the galaxy with celestial grace.</p>
            <p><strong>Elliptical Galaxies: </strong>Oval-shaped gatherings of stars, akin to cosmic footballs. These galaxies range from small, dense ellipses to giants hosting trillions of stars.</p>
              <p><strong>Irregular Galaxies: </strong> Playful and asymmetric, defying the structured forms of their counterparts. Irregular galaxies embody the whimsical nature of the universe.</p>

    <h1> Black holes</h1>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsDtpFEHbDpae6wBuW5wQo.jpg" alt="Black hole" style="width:1000px; height:1000px;">
    <p> Don't let the name fool you: a black hole is anything but empty space. Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York City. The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. In recent years, NASA instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are, to many, the most fascinating objects in space.</p>
    
    <h3> Other anomalies in space include</h3>
    <h3>Radio Signal Blaster</h3>
     <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/08/18/radio-signal-blaster-1660816875139.jpeg?fit=bounds&width=1280&height=720&dpr=2"  style="width:1000px; height:1000px;">
    <p> Scientists once discovered a mysterious celestial object that was pulsating in space, blasting out radio signals approximately 4000 light-years (almost 24 quadrillion miles) away from Earth. The object released giant bursts of energy, causing it to brighten for roughly 30 - 60 seconds once every 18 minutes, acting like a lighthouse in the vast ocean of the cosmos. Several people suggested that the object might be a neutron star or a white dwarf star with a very powerful magnetic field, but that is yet to be proven.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Solar System Traveller</h3>
     <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/08/18/solar-system-traveller-1660817377699.jpg?fit=bounds&width=1280&height=720&dpr=2"  style="width:1000px; height:1000px;">
    <p> A massive cigar-shaped object known as Oumuamua made headlines in 2017 when it whipped past Earth at an unusually high speed (196,000 mph, or 87.3 kps). NASA claimed that it was the first-ever object in our solar system that was "known to have originated elsewhere," but they were less certain about which star system it may have travelled from.</p>

          <h1> Recent space news</h1>
          <p> NASA's Webb reveals new features in heart of Milky Way: The latest image from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope shows a portion of the dense center of our galaxy in unprecedented detail, including never-before-seen features astronomers have yet to explain. The star-forming region, named Sagittarius C (Sgr C), is about 300 light-years from the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*.</p>
          <br>
          <p> Scientists find 14 new transient objects in space by peering through the 'Christmas Tree Galaxy Cluster': An international team of scientists, led by University of Missouri's Haojing Yan, used NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to discover 14 new transient objects during their time-lapse study of galaxy cluster MACS0416 -- located about 4.3 billion light years from Earth -- which they've dubbed as the "Christmas Tree Galaxy Cluster."
    
    "Transients are objects in space, like individual stars, that appear to suddenly brighten by orders of magnitudes and then fade away," said Yan, an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy</P>
      <br>
      <p>New findings support long-proposed process of planet formation: Scientists using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope just made a breakthrough discovery in revealing how planets are made. By observing water vapor in protoplanetary disks, Webb confirmed a physical process involving the drifting of ice-coated solids from the outer regions of the disk into the rocky-planet zone.
    
    Theories have long proposed that icy pebbles forming in the cold, outer regions of protoplanetary disks -- the same area where comets originate in our solar system -- should be the fundamental seeds of planet formation</p>

       <p> Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.
    
    Despite being inhospitable to humans, robotic explorers – like NASA's Perseverance rover – are serving as pathfinders to eventually get humans to the surface of the Red Planet. </P>
      <br>
      <h3> Fun fact </h3>
      <p>No other planet has captured our collective imagination quite like Mars.
    
    In the late 1800s when people first observed the canal-like features on Mars' surface, many speculated that an intelligent alien species resided there. This led to numerous stories about Martians, some of whom invade Earth, like in the 1938 radio drama, "The War of the Worlds." According to an enduring urban legend, many listeners believed the story to be real news coverage of an invasion, causing widespread panic.
    
    Countless stories since have taken place on Mars or explored the possibilities of its Martian inhabitants. Movies like "Total Recall" (1990 and 2012) take us to a terraformed Mars and a struggling colony running out of air. A Martian colony and Earth have a prickly relationship in "The Expanse" television series and novels. </p>

      <h1> Saturn overview </h1>
      <p> Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with a dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets.
    
    It is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
    
    The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter. </p>
      <h3> Fun fact about saturn </h3>
      <p> Perhaps the most iconic of all the planets in our solar system, Saturn is heavily present in pop culture.
    
    It provides a backdrop for numerous science fiction stories, movies, and TV shows, comics, and video games, including the "Cthulhu Mythos," "WALL-E," "2001: A Space Odyssey," and "Star Trek." In Tim Burton's film "Beetlejuice," a dusty, fictional Saturn is populated by giant sandworms. And in the 2014 movie "Interstellar," the wormhole that enables the astronauts to travel to another galaxy appears near Saturn.

      <h1> Titan, a brief overview </h1>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p> Saturn’s largest moon Titan is an extraordinary and exceptional world. Among our solar system’s more than 150 known moons, Titan is the only one with a substantial atmosphere. And of all the places in the solar system, Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have liquids in the form of rivers, lakes and seas on its surface.
    
    Titan is larger than the planet Mercury and is the second largest moon in our solar system. Jupiter's moon Ganymede is just a little bit larger (by about 2 percent).</p>   
      <h3> Did You Know? </h3>
      <p> As exotic as Titan might sound, in some ways it’s one of the most hospitable worlds in the solar system. Titan’s nitrogen atmosphere is so dense that a human wouldn’t need a pressure suit to walk around on the surface. He or she would, however, need an oxygen mask and protection against the cold—temperatures at Titan’s surface are around minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 179 Celsius) </p>
